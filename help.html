</div>
<h2>Campaign & lobby</h2>
<p> Experts have warned that, <strong>"To have these horrifying levels of destitution in a country like ours is a political choice."</strong> Our government must take urgent action. Campaigning and advocacy are about persuasion, influencing for change, and demonstrating value. You can advocate to anybody: friends, family, the media, bloggers, sponsors and funders.</p>
<p>Writing to politicians is a great way to raise awareness of child poverty because it's a quick, easy and effective way to make your voice heard. Politicians have the power to reduce child poverty on a national scale; by raising these issues with your MP, you're adding your voice to a national campaign demanding change. It's your MP's job to make your voice heard in Parliament, even if you did not vote for them. They represent their local area and can raise the concerns of local people by voting on issues in Parliament; writing to the government minister responsible for the issue or making an appointment to see them; asking Parliamentary Questions about issues you raise or asking for a debate in Parliament - a relevant minister will always attend this debate to respond to your MP on behalf of the government. MPs are unlikely to pay any attention if they think an issue doesn't affect their area, which is why it is so important for you to share your story.</p>
